# DiscordSmiteBot
A private bot for the Discord application that communicates with the Hi-Rez API for the game Smite (PC Version). I decided to write this one in Java, but plenty of other languages are supported utilizing either Discord's API in general, or an open-source framework similar to the one I am using (JDA from DV8? [Actual author and group names exist somewhere]).

I created this specifically for personal use for the fun of it, without any plans for scalability and whatnot. A list of commands and setup will be included after they are implemented. The output to Discord will be formated using their markdown format (https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-) which of course will be editable for one's on personal bias.

This project requires a DevId and authKey for the Hi-Rez Developers API, which is attainable from filling out the following form: https://fs12.formsite.com/HiRez/form48/secure_index.html, and the creation of an application for Discord (https://discordapp.com/) through their developer website: https://discordapp.com/developers.

Plenty of tutorials for creating a Discord Bot are available online, so
